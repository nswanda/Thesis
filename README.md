# muddy-thesis-template

This repository is named after the on-campus bar at MIT, _The Muddy_, in honor of all the thesis writing I would have done there if COVID-19 was not a thing. Accordingly, the styling (formatting, page numbers, coverpage) are appropriate for an MIT thesis. I found the provided MIT thesis template _too automated_ with comments and switches galore; this version automates only the most universal parts and lets the user manually input the details. Check the [MIT specifications for thesis formatting](https://libraries.mit.edu/distinctive-collections/thesis-specs/#format) to ensure you have the correct formatting for your graduation scenario (and congratulations!).

Everything is based on [`KOMA-script`](https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script?lang=en), so it is easy to make changes as you wish.

This repository is a light repackaging of amazing work from:
- [Pseudomanifold/latex-mimosis](https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/latex-mimosis)

## how to use
- This repo is fashioned as a template; to best use, log in with your GitHub account and click `use this template`
- To build, simply type `make build`
- To clean, simply type `make clean`
- Write your thesis :)

Personal preference: I use Sublime with the LaTeXing package. There are several help guides online to set this up correctly depending on your operating system.

## license

The template uses the MIT license. All software is "as is".
